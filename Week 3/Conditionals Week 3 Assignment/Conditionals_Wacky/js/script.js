/* This I'm having fun with. With this, I am trying to figure out if I can make the drive to somewhere
    I will have the user input a distance and from there I will also have the user input speed. I'm going to force the
    user to select a pre defined location, but they will be able to input the speed upon which they would like to get
    there. After that I will have the user input their age and let them know if they would live to see the end of the
    trip successfully. As a side note, I will try and figure out the relative speed of StarTrek and the Millennium Falcon
    as to give the user a possible chance of actually getting to their location alive. */
